# My Flower Garden

## Overview
My Flower Garden will help a user plan and manage the different flowers they plan on planting in the different areas of their yard or garden.  It will let you organize by location and container. It will also access a Plants API from https://perenual.com/ to search for plants or flowers and see some fun facts on those plants.
